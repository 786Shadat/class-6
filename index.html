        <p> <h3>1.</h3>Oh Abu Dharr! Take advantage of five things before five things seize you;
         Your youth before Your old age, your health before your sickness, Your wealth before your poverty,
         your spare time before your being busy and your life before you death.”
         “Oh Abu Dharr! Take advantage of five things before five things seize you;
         Your youth before Your old age, your health before your sickness, Your wealth before your poverty,

            <h3>2.</h3> “Oh Abu Dharr! Beware of Procrastination for you are (in) today and not (in) tomorrow.
            If there is a tomorrow for you, be tomorrow as you are today. If there isn’t a tomorrow for you, 
            you will grievously regret the opportunity you missed today.”
            <h3>3.</h3> “Oh Abu Dharr! Love of wealth and honour are stronger in stripping a 
            man of his religion than two ferocious wolves in a cattle pen of sheep; so they attack in it 
            until morning. So what will remain of it? So I said, “Oh Messenger of Allah (S),
            the fearful humble lowly people who remember Allah much, will they be the first among mankind
            to go to heaven?” So he said, “No. But it will be the poor among the Muslims. They will
            come outstripping the necks of mankind. The Keepers of Heaven will say to them, “Like that you 
            are until you are accounted of!” So they will say, “About what shall we be accounted for,
            for by Allah we didn’t own anything by which we could oppress or do justice and we weren’t
            given (wealth) so we could withhold or give (to others) but we worshipped our Lord until 
            He called us so we answered.”
            <h3>4.</h3>Oh Abu Dharr! Take account of yourself before you’re taken account of so your accounting will
            be easier tomorrow. And weigh yourself before you are weighed and prepare for the great staging; 
            the day you will be presented,
            not the least of a hidden thing of you will be hidden from Allah.
            Oh Abu Dharr!
             Take account of yourself before you’re taken account of so your accounting will be easier tomorrow. And weigh yourself before you are weighed and prepare for the great staging; the day you will be presented,
             not the least of a hidden thing of you will be hidden from Allah.”
